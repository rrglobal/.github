## Overview

This organization houses software projects and learning repositories for Rolls-Royce.  This organization is meant to be globally accessible by Rolls-Royce employees (and sometimes our external partners), but not public facing.  No export controlled source code should be stored in this organization.

Much of what you see here is part of the Rolls-Royce Software Factory's efforts to modernize agile software developement within Rolls-Royce.  To learn more, check out our docs site (non-public) hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://ghdocs.rollsroyce-sf.com) or hosted within our corporate network ([US Link](https://usdocs.rollsroyce-sf.com), [Global Link](https://docs.rollsroyce-sf.com)).
